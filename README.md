# Paycheck-Calculator

I was inspired to create this caluculator after completing Python for Everybody's Worked Exercise 4.6: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l93PhBUJ_S0
After getting a notice from my job that we would be paid $10 an hour extra on Sunday's I thought it would be helpful to compute my paycheck. This also takes taxes and other witholdings into account and gives us the total amount of the paycheck expected.
